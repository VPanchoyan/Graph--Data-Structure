## Graph 

> A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V). The edges can be referred to as the connections between vertices.The edge of the graph sometimes contains the Weight, which is used to show the _strength_ of each connection between vertices.

Graphs have a variety of different implementations, depending on the host language.
Most common representations are 
- with adjacent matrix
- with adjacent list

There are many algorithms to traverse the graph such as BFS (Breadth First Search), DFS (Depth First Search).
